Many of these ditches were dedicated over 100 years ago. The ditches in this layer were digitized from old-paper maps and were spatially adjusted to better align with their respective features. The information in the attribute table was derived from a separate document containing numerical IDs, names, and record information like the date recorded and the volume/page where the dedication can be located. Any information missing from the attribute table reflects that the respective data was missing from that separate document. For ditches with dates recorded over several years, the final date of completion is what is listed in the attribute table.", "Dublin Core:Subject": "Transportation", "GeoBlacklight:Information Page": "http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bef482be59e8473fa4f3228b9fd3380a_0", "Dublin Core:Date Issued": "3/14/2019", "GeoBlacklight:Web Map Service": "", "GeoBlacklight:Geometry Type": "Vector", "Dublin Core:Source": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Accrual Method": "ArcGIS Hub", "Dublin Core:Coverage": "-81.6534,40.6418,-81.1039,40.9924", "Dublin Core:References": "\\\"http://schema.org/url\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bef482be59e8473fa4f3228b9fd3380a_0\\\",\\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bef482be59e8473fa4f3228b9fd3380a_0.zip\\\",\\\"urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer\\\":\\\"https://scgisa.starkcountyohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Engineer/DedicatedDitches/MapServer/0\\\"", "Dublin Core:Temporal Coverage": "", "Dublin Core:Requires": "", "Dublin Core:Format": "Shapefile", "Dublin Core:Alternative Title": "Dedicated Off-road Ditches", "Dublin Core:Identifier": "bef482be59e8473fa4f3228b9fd3380a_0", "Dublin Core:Creator": "Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program", "Dublin Core:Type": "Dataset|Service", "tags": "MapServer", "GeoBlacklight:Open Index Map": "", "Dublin Core:Extent": "Geospatial data", "Code": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Replaces": "", "GeoBlacklight:Thumbnail": "", "Item Type Metadata:Status": "Active", "Dublin Core:Is Part Of": "State Agencies Geospatial Data", "Dublin Core:Publisher": "State of Ohio", "Dublin Core:Spatial Coverage": "Ohio, United States", "Dublin Core:Date Accepted": "6/12/2019"}
