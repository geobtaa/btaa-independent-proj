The data was download in May, 2019, from the NRCS GeoSpatialDataGateway and only sections within the extent of the county boundary were included in this layer. The State of Ohio was subdivided using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The PLSS initially subdivided lands into townships, which were numbered using a grid system. Townships were numbered horizontally and cross-referenced with vertical numbers referred to as the range. Each township was further divided into one-mile sections, which were subsequently divided into quarter-sections.", "Dublin Core:Subject": "Planning and Cadastral", "GeoBlacklight:Information Page": "http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2bfc40ce8fef4487ad1896e0b9b2b925_0", "Dublin Core:Date Issued": "5/31/2019", "GeoBlacklight:Web Map Service": "", "GeoBlacklight:Geometry Type": "Vector", "Dublin Core:Source": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Accrual Method": "ArcGIS Hub", "Dublin Core:Coverage": "-81.65143832216818,40.6346133010841,-81.08158068273819,40.988042100402794", "Dublin Core:References": "\\\"http://schema.org/url\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2bfc40ce8fef4487ad1896e0b9b2b925_0\\\",\\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2bfc40ce8fef4487ad1896e0b9b2b925_0.zip\\\",\\\"urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#FeatureLayer\\\":\\\"https://services2.arcgis.com/1JiK2PayqrHvvJhM/arcgis/rest/services/PLSS_Sections/FeatureServer/0\\\"", "Dublin Core:Temporal Coverage": "", "Dublin Core:Requires": "", "Dublin Core:Format": "Shapefile", "Dublin Core:Alternative Title": "PLSS Sections (in Stark County)", "Dublin Core:Identifier": "2bfc40ce8fef4487ad1896e0b9b2b925_0", "Dublin Core:Creator": "Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program", "Dublin Core:Type": "Dataset|Service", "tags": "FeatureServer", "GeoBlacklight:Open Index Map": "", "Dublin Core:Extent": "Geospatial data", "Code": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Replaces": "", "GeoBlacklight:Thumbnail": "", "Item Type Metadata:Status": "Active", "Dublin Core:Is Part Of": "State Agencies Geospatial Data", "Dublin Core:Publisher": "State of Ohio", "Dublin Core:Spatial Coverage": "Ohio, United States", "Dublin Core:Date Accepted": "6/12/2019"}
