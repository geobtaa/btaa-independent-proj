Geodetic control monuments or markers make up a network of stable, identifiable points with published datum values derived from observations. This layer includes markers set by numerous organizations over the past century, with the earliest makers being set by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS) in 1934 and the most recent being set by the Stark County Engineer (SCE) in 2011. Most of the points are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83); released in 1986. The attribute table includes detailed information on the spatial location of each point.", "Dublin Core:Subject": "Location", "GeoBlacklight:Information Page": "http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b29484e69204420a8ac4e2c762fc8dcc_0", "Dublin Core:Date Issued": "5/30/2019", "GeoBlacklight:Web Map Service": "", "GeoBlacklight:Geometry Type": "Vector", "Dublin Core:Source": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Accrual Method": "ArcGIS Hub", "Dublin Core:Coverage": "-81.6511,40.6293,-81.0774,40.9928", "Dublin Core:References": "\\\"http://schema.org/url\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b29484e69204420a8ac4e2c762fc8dcc_0\\\",\\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b29484e69204420a8ac4e2c762fc8dcc_0.zip\\\",\\\"urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer\\\":\\\"https://scgisa.starkcountyohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Engineer/SCSE_ControlPoints2014/MapServer/0\\\"", "Dublin Core:Temporal Coverage": "2011", "Dublin Core:Requires": "", "Dublin Core:Format": "Shapefile", "Dublin Core:Alternative Title": "Geodetic Control Monuments", "Dublin Core:Identifier": "b29484e69204420a8ac4e2c762fc8dcc_0", "Dublin Core:Creator": "Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program", "Dublin Core:Type": "Dataset|Service", "tags": "MapServer", "GeoBlacklight:Open Index Map": "", "Dublin Core:Extent": "Geospatial data", "Code": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Replaces": "", "GeoBlacklight:Thumbnail": "", "Item Type Metadata:Status": "Active", "Dublin Core:Is Part Of": "State Agencies Geospatial Data", "Dublin Core:Publisher": "State of Ohio", "Dublin Core:Spatial Coverage": "Ohio, United States", "Dublin Core:Date Accepted": "6/12/2019"}
