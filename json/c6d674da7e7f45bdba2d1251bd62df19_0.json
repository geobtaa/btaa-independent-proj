The features in layer include the full extent of every subwatershed in the county. The data was download in May, 2019, from the NRCS?GeoSpatialDataGateway. This layer is part of the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The WBD is a 1:24,000 scale expanded version of the hydrologic units created in the mid-1970's by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) under the sponsorship of the Water Resources Council. The WBD is a complete set of hydrologic units from new watershed and subwatersheds less than 10,000 acres to entire river systems draining large hydrologic unit regions, all attributed by standard nomenclature. Development of the WBD started in the early 1990's and progressed to the format and attribution in this layer. The delineation and attribution was done on a state basis using a variety of methods and source data.This layer depicts subwatersheds, which have 12-digit hydrologic unit codes (HUCs). They are sometimes referred to as 6th-level HUCs or 6th-level subwatersheds.
