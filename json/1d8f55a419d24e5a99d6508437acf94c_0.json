This version of the NHD was last updated in 2016.The High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) provides a hydrologic framework of the United States' surface water drainage network. This layer displays the key features of the High Resolution NHD including streams and rivers, waterbodies and other area features and points features such as sinks, waterfalls, gauging stations, wells, and springs.The NHD was created through collaboration between the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). USGS is currently responsible for updating and maintaining the NHD. This layer is of the high-resolution NHD, which was created at a scale of 1:24,000 to enhance the original NHD, which was created at a scale of 1:100,000.", "Dublin Core:Subject": "Inland Waters", "GeoBlacklight:Information Page": "http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1d8f55a419d24e5a99d6508437acf94c_0", "Dublin Core:Date Issued": "5/31/2019", "GeoBlacklight:Web Map Service": "", "GeoBlacklight:Geometry Type": "Vector", "Dublin Core:Source": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Accrual Method": "ArcGIS Hub", "Dublin Core:Coverage": "-81.6512611041714,40.62912918462832,-81.08208079369942,40.993226706549315", "Dublin Core:References": "\\\"http://schema.org/url\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1d8f55a419d24e5a99d6508437acf94c_0\\\",\\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1d8f55a419d24e5a99d6508437acf94c_0.zip\\\",\\\"urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#FeatureLayer\\\":\\\"https://services2.arcgis.com/1JiK2PayqrHvvJhM/arcgis/rest/services/NHD_Waterways/FeatureServer/0\\\"", "Dublin Core:Temporal Coverage": "", "Dublin Core:Requires": "", "Dublin Core:Format": "Shapefile", "Dublin Core:Alternative Title": "NHD Waterways (in Stark County)", "Dublin Core:Identifier": "1d8f55a419d24e5a99d6508437acf94c_0", "Dublin Core:Creator": "Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program", "Dublin Core:Type": "Dataset|Service", "tags": "FeatureServer", "GeoBlacklight:Open Index Map": "", "Dublin Core:Extent": "Geospatial data", "Code": "11a-01", "Dublin Core:Replaces": "", "GeoBlacklight:Thumbnail": "", "Item Type Metadata:Status": "Active", "Dublin Core:Is Part Of": "State Agencies Geospatial Data", "Dublin Core:Publisher": "State of Ohio", "Dublin Core:Spatial Coverage": "Ohio, United States", "Dublin Core:Date Accepted": "6/12/2019"}
